# memory_hacking_core
Iv been getting into memory hacking recently. Instead of rewritting every component over and over again for every 
project why not make a general purpose repository that contains alot of the things needed for memory hacking?

This repo does not have to be used for memory hacking, it has a bunch of other things that can also be useful for any project!

## Todo:
- convert everything into CMakeLists
- add support for MAC OS and 64 bit window
- add keybinds
- add console UI
- add settings UI
